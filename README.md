# ArduPilot Grafana Companion

Analyze livestreaming flight telemetry from your ArduPilot drone in Grafana, powered by Mavlink, Telegraf and VictoriaMetrics.

Have you ever wished it was easier to use Grafana's top-tier dashboarding capability
on drone projects? Now you can. Telegraf has a [new mavlink input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/mavlink), allowing
direct capture of flight telemetry from any Mavlink drone.

This project is an example of how you can combine Telegraf, Grafana, and VictoriaMetrics to ingest, store and query live flight telemetry.

The project is designed to work with ArduPilot drones but should work with any Mavlink-compatible drone which outputs standard messages.
